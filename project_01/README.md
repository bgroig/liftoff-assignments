# Capstone Project Plan

## Overview

I plan on creating a web application that allows musicians to connect with each other
within their communities.  The application will have some similarities to Faceboork
in that it will be a social platform.  User's will create a profile and explain what
their musical interests and abilities are as well as their location.  They will also be
able to search or see musicians with similar interests and abilities in their general
location.  The ultimate goal is for the musicians to then meet up and begin playing,
talking about, listening to, or gathering together all in the name of the music they
love.

## Features

1.  Homepage
	- Features links to the registration page, login page and search engine to find specific
	musicians

4.  Profile
	- Once the user has registered they will be directed here to create their profile
	which will include the following:
	- Name
	- Instrument(s)
	- Styles of music
	- Level of ability
	- Location
	- Contact information
5.  Search Engine

## What I'll Have to Learn

That problem that I need to solve while making this application is to figure out
how to make the application secure so that the application cannot be easily hacked.  I
also want to figure out how to make the application as user friendly as possible.  I'm not
sure what technology to use for this but will do some research to find out.
